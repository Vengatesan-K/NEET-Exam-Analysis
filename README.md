### Introduction
The NEET Examination Results Analysis project performs descriptive analysis using Power BI to explore historical data and predictive analysis using time series and machine learning algorithms to forecast future trends based on past NEET examination results.

### Features
- Descriptive analysis using Power BI
- Predictive analysis using time series analysis
- Machine learning algorithms for prediction
- Visualization of results

### Technologies Used

- [x] Power BI
- [x] Python
- [x] Pandas
- [x] NumPy
- [x] Scikit-learn
- [x] Time series analysis libraries (e.g., statsmodels, Prophet)
- [x] Jupyter Notebook

### Usage
- Run the descriptive analysis report in Power BI by opening the provided .pbix file.
   - Access the Jupyter Notebooks in the Notebooks directory for predictive analysis and machine learning algorithms.
     - Follow the instructions in the notebooks to execute the code and perform predictions.
### Data
> The data used in this project is sourced from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_cum_Entrance_Test_(Undergraduate)#Number_of_applicants_by_year). Please refer to the Dataset directory for the dataset used.

### Descriptive Analysis
The descriptive analysis provides insights into historical NEET examination results using visualizations and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Check the Power BI report for detailed analysis.

### Predictive Analysis
The predictive analysis involves time series analysis and machine learning algorithms to forecast future NEET examination trends. Refer to the Jupyter Notebooks for implementation details.

### Results
| Insights |
| --- |
|ðŸ“ŠEach passing year witnesses a mounting eagerness among graduates to undertake the NEET Entrance Exam, driven by an unwavering ambition to enter the esteemed field of medicine as aspiring doctors.|
|ðŸ“ŠBased on historical data, individuals from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra have consistently qualified in the Entrance Examination. Hence, there is a potential for growth in the northeastern and northwestern regions, where increased interest and encouragement for participation in this subject should be fostered.|
|ðŸ“ŠAfter introducing regional languages in the entrance exam, there has been a notable surge in registrations. Therefore, it is recommended to ensure that the exam is made more comprehensible, facilitating easier qualification.|
|ðŸ“ŠThere is a lower participation rate among SC and ST communities in entrance exams, highlighting the necessity to encourage and enhance coaching opportunities for them. Additionally, there is a disparity in male participation, resulting in a lower registration and qualification rate in the exams.|
